The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it’s too late. (Seymour Cray) Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. (Martin Golding) Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning. (Rick Cook) There’s an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone. That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone. (Bjarne Stroustrup) The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous)
